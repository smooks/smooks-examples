About This Example:
===================
    This is a very simple example that illustrates how to
    configure Smooks to process CSV records into Java objects.

    See:
        1. The "Main" class in src/main/java/example/Main.java.
        2. The Customer and Gender Types.
        3. The input message in input-message.csv.
        4. smooks-config.xml.
        5. See how to solve the same use case using a programmatic (non-XML)
           Smooks configuration in the "csv-to-java-programmatic" example.
