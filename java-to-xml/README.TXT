About This Example:
===================
    This example illustrates how Smooks can be used to transform a Java object graph
    to XML.  It shows how to use a JavaSource to supply a Java object graph to Smooks
    for transformation.

    This example is very basic.  It performs no additional transforms over the default
    XML produced by Smooks when supplied a JavaSource.  You could add additional resource
    configurations to the smooks-config.xml to perform additional transformations on the
    default XML.  See the "java-to-java" example as an example of how to perform aditional
    transforms on the XML eventPresentEvent stream produced by a JavaSource input source.

    See:
        1. The "Main" class in src/main/java/example/Main.java.
        2. The input Java model in the src/main/java/example/model package.
        3. smooks-config.xml.
