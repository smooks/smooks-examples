About This Example:
===================
 	This is a very simple example that illustrates the use
 	of the YAML reader within Smooks

	The following features are demonstrated:
	  - Whitespace replacement
	  - Element name replacement
	  - Anchor and alias resolving (by default an anchor is referred to instead of resolved)

	See the smooks-config.xml for inline comments.

    See:
        1. The "Main" class in src/main/java/example/Main.java.
        2. The input message in input-message.jsn.
        3. smooks-config.xml.
