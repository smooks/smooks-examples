Smooks Examples
===============

![Build Status](https://github.com/smooks/smooks-examples/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

Examples are essential for helping newcomers in getting started with Smooks. This project is a catalogue of code examples illustrating the many uses of Smooks. Most of the examples are accompanied by a README file that describes the example and instructions on how to run it. [Maven 3](https://maven.apache.org/) and JDK 17 need to be installed in order to build any of the examples. All the examples are built and run in the same way:

1. Build all the examples with `mvn clean package`
2. Run an example by changing to the directory containing the example and running `mvn exec:exec`

Read the [Smooks User Guide](https://www.smooks.org/v2/documentation/) to learn more about Smooks. Example contributions in the form of [pull requests](https://github.com/smooks/smooks-examples/pulls) are more than welcome, and in fact, such contributions are encouraged since they will help the Smooks community grow.

## Catalogue

The following table briefly describes each example within this project. More information on an example can be found in the accompanying README file within the example's directory.

## Smooks Execution Report

Most of the examples generate a Smooks Execution Report in the `target/report` directory of the example.  This can be a useful tool for comprehending the processing performed by Smooks.
