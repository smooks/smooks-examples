About this example
==================
    This is an example that illustrates how to
    configure Smooks to process CSV records into Java objects.

    See:
        1. The "Main" class in src/main/java/example/Main.java. Note the
           programmatic configuration of the Smooks instance in the
           runSmooksTransform method.
        2. The Customer and Gender Types.
        3. The input message in input-message.csv.
        5. See how to solve the same use case using an XML
           Smooks configuration in the "csv-to-java" example.
